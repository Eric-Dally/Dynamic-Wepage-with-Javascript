# UFOs
Using javascript, boostrap, and D3

## Overview of the analysis:
The purpose of this project was to visualize UFO sightings by customizing a webpage using the Bootstrap framework, and equipping a table with several fully functional filters that will allow users to interact with UFO data.

## Results:

In this challenge, four new filters were created to allow the user to search with different criteria. With the new set up, the user can search for UFO sightings by the city, state, country, or shape of the suspected UFO. For the filter to work, atleast one input must be entered. However, the user can enter all five inputs for more specific results.

## Summary:

### Drawbacks:

** One drawback is that the user does not have the ability to enter multiple inputes for one search parameter. For instance, one can only enter one date instead of two. 

** Another drawback is that the user can not organize the data in numerical/alphebetical order.

### Additional Recommendations:

To address both drawbacks, I would recommend that a the filter be updated to included multiple searches per parameter and allow sorting among each search parameter. In addition, I would include another search parameter so that the user can search by the time duration of each sighting.
